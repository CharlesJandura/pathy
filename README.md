## Pathy
# An interactive visualizer of the pathfinding algorithm a* using Python and Pygame.

This was my final project for my Data Structure & Algorithms class. I decided I wanted to challenge myself and have fun to finish off my degree at County College of Morris.

# Installation
Simply download pathy.exe and run it!

# Use
Left Click - Draw
Right Click - Erase
C - Clear All
Space - Start Program and watch the magic happen!

The first space you click on will be your start point, the second is your end point, and everything past that are barriers. The program will automatically detect what you're missing in that order and dynamically change to what you need to create.

# Files
Pathy.py - The main program. The scope of the program didn't warrant multiple files so here's the whole thing!

pathy_ondraw.png - PNG of an example input for the program, showing what it would look like when you've drawn on the screen.

pathy_onstart.png - PNG of the greeting message and control guide.

pathy_output.png - PNG of an example output of what the program would look like once it has finished running.

pathy.exe - Simple executable file used to run the program.
